        <h2>Technologies I have become acquainted with</h2>
        <p>
            Currently, I work in web development, using .NET MVC4+, Ruby on Rails, and the technologies that come with
            those realms such as Visual Studio TFS, git, and other source control mechanisms. I have used front-end web frameworks,
            such as AngularJS, to create UI/UX rich web applications, I have been involved with devops operations such as
            setting up servers and coming up with deployment mechanisms for fellow developers and teams using Apache/Apache Tomcat,
            Docker, Ansible, and hooking up continuous integration sites, such as Codeship and Jenkins to projects. I have also
            done Andriod and iOS mobile development.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am always willing to learn more and go more in depth into software development design patterns and languages.
        </p>
        <p>
            I started off as a game developer. I knew a lot about the Unity 3D game engine and the Unreal Engine.
            Diving into those two engines kick started my thirst for software development knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
            My internship at nliven systems involved me developing with the Unity 3D engine, doing rigging and technical
            art with Autodesk Maya, and doing 2D animation with Adobe Photoshop and Edge.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now, I apply software design patterns, infused with the creative and innovative ideas from my game development
            days to full stack web development.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the side, I still feed my passion for creating games, as well as learning other technologies that are relevant
            to my career, on my own.
