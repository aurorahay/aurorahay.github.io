            <p>The above is a phrase I often utter when speaking on the phone with my co-workers in Scrum meetings.</p>
            <p>I have had the privilege to work with amazing individuals on several different projects in the software
                industry as a software engineer.</p>
            <p>I have used different technologies to "get the job done", but, I not only focus on how a technology
                works, but rather why I am using it or what design patterns or human centered design principles I can utilize
                to make my and my fellow engineers' jobs easier and our clients happy.</p>
