        <h2>Some Code Samples</h2>
        <p>
            Aside from this whole site being a code sample, I have a few snippets that I have written in my career that I am
            fairly proud of.

        <p>
            They may not be the most "perfect" pieces of code, but they have rich value in that they either saved my team and I
            quite a bit of time developing. As a side note, I try to follow the "DRY" principle, and, from these examples,
            other patterns of design within software.

            Please have a look, and be inspired as needed :)

            <h3>A simple adapter (JavaScript, _.js, AngularJS)</h3>
            <p>
                This code sample was used to convert pretty much any JSON data set to create a D3.js line graph. The main
                method used is "convertModelToGraphModel". That method is only about 20 lines long, but, there is a whole mess
                of lodash.js going on to make it look simple.
            </p>
            <p>
                This adapter made making line graphs a cinch when using large sets of JSON that looked completely different!
