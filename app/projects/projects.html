                <h3><a href="http://a2.agile6.com/">A2 - Agile Acquisition Tool</a></h3>
                <p>This project is an example of rapid prototyping.</p>
                <p><a href="https://github.com/agilesix/ADPQ" target="_blank">The source code can be found here.</a></p>
                <p>We were challenged to build a prototype of a "Knowledge Management Tool" within three weeks. But, we went beyond that and created a tool that contracting professionals could use to not only store knoweldge, but to build their portfolio for their agile acquisition needs.</p>
                <p>I was the DevOps Engineer as well as a Full-stack Web Developer for this project. I got to play with newer technologies that I had to do a lot of research to figure out how to use.
                </p>
                <p>But it was worth it.
                </p>
                <p>I also got to build the APIs and consume them, which made development time super quick.</p>
                <p>And, I got to contribute tremendously to the architecture of the application.</p>
                <p>The APIs being consumed are documented using the OpenAPI spec, and I used Swagger as the tool.</p>
                <p>AWS, Docker/docker-compose, Angular 5, Ruby on Rails, and several other open-source technologies were used to piece this together.</p>

                <h3><a href="http://meglioknives.com/" target="_blank">Meglio Knives</a></h3>
                <p>I truly believe in high-quality products and fundamental values that make up a person's core.</p>
                <p>This knife company represents both of those aspects in so many ways.</p>
                <p>So, I made a website to represent what they do: create beautiful, custom made knives, as well as the best production kitchen knife that is out there as far as materials and craftsmanship go.</p>
                <p>I also got to make an Android mobile application to help track manufactoring inventory and orders, rather than just sales orders. That was plenty of fun to do.</p>
                <p>Ruby on Rails, Docker/docker-compose for development environment, AngularJS, Snipcart for e-commerce, and other technologies were used in the making of this application.</p>
                <p>I am using Heroku for deployment and scalable hosting.</p>

                <h3><a href="http://www.agile6.com/" target="_blank">Agile Six Applications, Inc.</a></h3>
                <p>This is my favorite and most proud of project that I have participated in.</p>
                <p>I was asked to build a website for some of my most favorite people in the software development industry;
                    It is quite the honor to have my name behind this site and company.</p>
                <p>I worked with my favorite UI/UX designer, illustrator and artist,
                    <a href="http://www.katherinerasmussen.com/" target="_blank">Katherine Rasmussen</a>,
                    to make a well designed and functioning website for the company Agile Six Applications.
                </p>
                <p>Perhaps the most amazing aspect of this website is that it was built in about a month on a part-time schedule
                    with a continuous deployment mechanism that I set up using Docker. Yet, it proves that with incredible
                    user-centered design, flow, and an MVP approach, an application can be spun up quickly and efficiently
                    with great gains.
                </p>
