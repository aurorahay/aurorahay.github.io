            <p>This is my favorite and most proud of project that I have participated in.</p>
            <p>I was asked to build a website for some of my most favorite people in the software development industry;
                It is quite the honor to have my name behind this site and company.</p>
            <p>I worked with my favorite UI/UX designer, illustrator and artist
                <a href="http://www.katherinerasmussen.com/" target="_blank">Katherine Rasmussen</a>
                to make a well designed and functioning website for the company Agile Six Applications.
            </p>
            <p>Perhaps the most amazing aspect of this website is that it was built in about a month on a part-time schedule
                with a continuous deployment mechanism that I set up using Docker. Yet, it proves that with incredible
                user-centered design, flow, and an MVP approach, an application can be spun up quickly and efficiently
                with great gains.
